As the darkness fades, Halliday’s voice echoes ominously, announcing that Innovative Online Industries (IOI) has taken control of the OASIS. A virus has infected the main server, causing chaos as players everywhere are losing their progress.
In the midst of the turmoil, Artemis suddenly appears before you, her avatar glitching and flickering. With a sense of urgency, she hands you a file and whispers something you can’t quite make out before her form disintegrates into a shower of pixels.
Stunned and overwhelmed, you stare at the mysterious file, trying to make sense of it. Just then, a familiar voice breaks through the confusion—it’s Artemis, but this time she’s speaking from the real world. She explains that the file she gave you is the key to freeing the OASIS from IOI’s control. 
Although she was captured and her character was deleted, she managed to pass on this crucial information in a final act of rebellion.
From now on, Artemis will be available to provide hints as you face challenges on your journey. But these hints will only be accessible after a certain amount of time, and they’ll cost you points (though the exact amount is still unclear). 
Your task: find the flag hidden within the file.
